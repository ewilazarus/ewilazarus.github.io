Hello there, readers.

On this blog post I intend to write about a framework I've been using for writing technical documents on my current role.

I'll start by sharing a personal perspective on the importance of training the "technical-writing muscle" for software engineers, jump into some grammar and styling concepts, and finally present the framework itself.

Most of the content you're about to read has been shamelessly copied and adapted from [Google's tech-writing course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview).

Without further ado, let's get into it.

## The Importance of Tech-Writing

If you've been on the Software Engineering industry for long enough, then you might have noticed that coding is just a part of the job. In fact, the amount of actual coding is inversely proportional to the engineer seniority â€” the more junior and unexperienced one is, the more coding it does, whereas, as it steps up in the career, it starts to take on different responsibilities.

It's not uncommon to see staff or principal engineers that do almost no coding at all. Their job envolves a deep knowledge about what different products do, and how different teams operate. They're often responsible for setting the technical expectations and coordinating multiple teams to achieve organization wide goals. Usually, these organization wide goals tend to be platform related, or envolve repeatedly used internal libraries.

Introducing a new CI/CD service, changing a caching strategy, migrating to a different cloud provider, and updating framework versions, are examples of activities often led by the most senior engineers within a company.

More often than not, the best way to approach these kinds of tasks is to create a [real-time collaboration document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor) to describe the current situation and to delineate some possible solutions. The delineated solutions include their pros and cons, and their estimated amount of work and time to market. 

There's even the concept of an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**, that is commonly used as a template for such documents.



I have been a software engineer for over a decade now, and as I step up in my career, I feel a growing need for having good technical writing skills, specially if working remotely.

The reason for that urge is provenient from two major aspects:

1. With good writing comes organized and straightforward thinking, meaning that if you're able to organize your thoughts in structured and well concatenated sentences, the amount of noise in your understanding diminishes.

2. If there's still noise in your understanding of a subject, then whoever your target audience is will be able to spot it and point it out, so you all get aligned on the same page.

There is also one other compeling aspect to having good written documents and that is the possibility to reach people that you probably wouldn't if you haven't written anything down. Think of when working in a company, you could end up reaching people higher in hierarchy, or if you leave it 

To support this post, I'm going to go over [Google's tech writing course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing).
