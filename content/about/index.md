Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm delighted to have you in my blog, where I share a glimpse of my journey. My name is Gabriel Lima, and I come from the vibrant and culturally rich landscape of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At {{< age >}} years young, life has been a tapestry of experiences that I'm eager to unfold.

Nurturing a beautiful family alongside my beloved wife, Erica, is a cornerstone of my joy. Our greatest gift, our son Antonio, brings boundless laughter and love into our lives.

During the day, I don the hat of a professional software engineer, delving deep into the realms of backend development, distributed systems, and the intricate art of algorithms. My academic journey led me to the prestigious halls of [PUC-Rio](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/en/), where I graduated in computer science in 2014. My professional trajectory has traversed diverse domains, including statistics, e-commerce, fintech, and a few personal projects.

When I'm off-duty, my top pastimes include:

- Running
- Weightlifting
- TV shows/movies
- Fiction books
- Video games
- Beach
- Brazilian politics

Your presence here enriches this digital space, and I'm excited to connect with you through shared experiences.
