Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm thrilled to welcome you to my personal space where I share a glimpse of my journey. My name is Gabriel Lima, and I hail from the vibrant and culturally rich landscape of Brazil. At {{< age >}} years young, life has been a tapestry of experiences that I'm eager to unfold.

Nurturing a beautiful family alongside my beloved wife, Erica, is a cornerstone of my joy. Our greatest blessing, our son Antonio, brings boundless laughter and love to our lives.

By day, I don the hat of a professional software engineer, delving deep into the realms of backend development, distributed systems, and the intricate art of algorithms. My academic voyage led me to the prestigious halls of [PUC-Rio](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/en/) where I graduated with a degree in computer science back in 2014. My professional path has meandered through diverse domains such as statistics, e-commerce, fintech, and the fertile grounds of personal pet projects.

When the clock winds down, I revel in the delights of life. From invigorating workouts that fuel my spirit to indulging in the mesmerizing narratives woven by movies and series. The pages of fiction books often become my escape, and virtual worlds of video games offer thrilling odysseys. And what better way to harmonize with nature's rhythm than by basking in the sun-kissed embrace of the beach?

Within this digital haven, I aspire to pen my musings on the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, share insights into my cherished hobbies, engage in contemplations on politics, and offer glimpses into the kaleidoscope of my personal reflections.

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. Your presence here enriches this digital chronicle, and I'm excited to connect with you through words and shared experiences.
