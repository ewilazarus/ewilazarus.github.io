[{"content":" Welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m delighted to have you in my blog, where I share a glimpse of my journey. My name is Gabriel Lima, and I come from the vibrant and culturally rich landscape of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At 35 years young, life has been a tapestry of experiences that I\u0026rsquo;m eager to unfold.\nNurturing a beautiful family alongside my beloved wife, Erica, is a cornerstone of my joy. Our greatest gift, our son Antonio, brings boundless laughter and love into our lives.\nDuring the day, I don the hat of a professional software engineer, delving deep into the realms of backend development, distributed systems, and the intricate art of algorithms. My academic journey led me to the prestigious halls of PUC-Rio, where I graduated in computer science in 2014. My professional trajectory has traversed diverse domains, including statistics, e-commerce, fintech, and a few personal projects.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m off-duty, my top pastimes include:\nRunning Weightlifting TV shows/movies Fiction books Video games Beach Brazilian politics Your presence here enriches this digital space, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to connect with you through shared experiences.\n","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"ewilogs","summary":"Welcome to my corner of the internet!","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/blogging/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"blogging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/community/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"community"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/discipline/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"discipline"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"ewilogs","summary":"","title":"ewilogs"},{"content":"Hey there, dear readers!\nI\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to welcome you to my brand-new blog, a digital canvas where thoughts, ideas, and experiences will be woven together.\nAs I embark on this exciting journey, allow me to take a moment to share with you the essence of why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to plunge into the world of blogging.\nThe Birth of a Blog # In a world bustling with information, opinions, and stories, I find myself yearning for a space to call my own — a platform where I can express my thoughts, reflect on life\u0026rsquo;s adventures, and perhaps even make a positive impact on others.\nThis blog represents a slice of my life, a sanctuary where ideas can flourish, and connections can be nurtured.\nA Haven of Discipline # One might wonder, \u0026ldquo;Why start a blog now?\u0026rdquo; The answer lies in the concept of discipline — a value I hold dear and intend to uphold steadfastly throughout this blogging journey.\nLife, as we know, can get rather hectic, and commitments tend to sway like leaves in the wind. That\u0026rsquo;s where discipline comes in.\nBy committing to regular posts, I\u0026rsquo;m not only challenging myself creatively but also cultivating a habit of consistency that will trickle into other aspects of my life.\nGiving Back to the Community # As an engineer that\u0026rsquo;s been working over 10 years with computer programming, I have been consuming blog posts from people that put aside some time to register drops of knowledge.\nThose posts really helped me grasp concepts, debug things and solve problems that I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t if they didn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nI feel that until today I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to give back to the community, and this is another reason I want to start this blog. Hopefully I can help someone, someday.\nImproving my Writing # I think my writing skills are far from great. By having this commitment of posting often, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to force myself to write more, and therefore I hope to get better at it.\nAlso, I might as well end up improving my English and translation skills, as I intend to maintain this a bilingual blog (English/Portuguese).\nI hope to see you again. Until next time!\n","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hey there, dear readers!","title":"Hello, world!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/writing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"writing"}]
