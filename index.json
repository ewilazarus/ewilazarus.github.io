[{"content":" Welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to welcome you to my personal space where I share a glimpse of my journey. My name is Gabriel Lima, and I hail from the vibrant and culturally rich landscape of Brazil. At 35 years young, life has been a tapestry of experiences that I\u0026rsquo;m eager to unfold.\nNurturing a beautiful family alongside my beloved wife, Erica, is a cornerstone of my joy. Our greatest blessing, our son Antonio, brings boundless laughter and love to our lives.\nBy day, I don the hat of a professional software engineer, delving deep into the realms of backend development, distributed systems, and the intricate art of algorithms. My academic voyage led me to the prestigious halls of PUC-Rio where I graduated with a degree in computer science back in 2014. My professional path has meandered through diverse domains such as statistics, e-commerce, fintech, and the fertile grounds of personal pet projects.\nWhen the clock winds down, I revel in the delights of life. From invigorating workouts that fuel my spirit to indulging in the mesmerizing narratives woven by movies and series. The pages of fiction books often become my escape, and virtual worlds of video games offer thrilling odysseys. And what better way to harmonize with nature\u0026rsquo;s rhythm than by basking in the sun-kissed embrace of the beach?\nWithin this digital haven, I aspire to pen my musings on the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, share insights into my cherished hobbies, engage in contemplations on politics, and offer glimpses into the kaleidoscope of my personal reflections.\nThank you for embarking on this journey with me. Your presence here enriches this digital chronicle, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to connect with you through words and shared experiences.\n","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"ewilogs","summary":"Welcome to my corner of the internet!","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/discipline/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"discipline"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/","section":"ewilogs","summary":"","title":"ewilogs"},{"content":"Hey there, dear readers!\nI\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to welcome you to my brand-new blog, a digital canvas where thoughts, ideas, and experiences will be intricately woven together. As I embark on this exciting journey, allow me to take a moment to share with you the essence of why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to plunge into the world of blogging.\nThe Birth of a Blog # In a world bustling with information, opinions, and stories, I find myself yearning for a space to call my own — a platform where I can express my thoughts, reflect on life\u0026rsquo;s adventures, and perhaps even make a positive impact on others. This blog represents a slice of my life, a sanctuary where ideas can flourish, and connections can be nurtured.\nA Haven of Discipline # One might wonder, \u0026ldquo;Why start a blog now?\u0026rdquo; The answer lies in the concept of discipline — a value I hold dear and intend to uphold steadfastly throughout this blogging journey. Life, as we know, can get rather hectic, and commitments tend to sway like leaves in the wind. That\u0026rsquo;s where discipline comes in. By committing to regular monthly posts, I\u0026rsquo;m not only challenging myself creatively but also cultivating a habit of consistency that will trickle into other aspects of my life.\nI hope to see you again.
